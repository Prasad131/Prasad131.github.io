<h2>Computational Fluid Dynamics For Incompressible Flows</h2>
<h3>NPTEL Live Sessions (Jan-May 2026)</h3>
<h4>Durga Prasad Pydi</h4>
</section>

<!-- About Course -->
<section>
<h2>About Course</h2>
<p>This is introductory course on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This course will primarily cover the basics of computational fluid dynamics starting from classification of partial differential equations, linear solvers, finite difference method and finite volume method for discretizing Laplace equation, convective-diffusive equation & Navier-Stokes equations. The course will help faculty members, students and researchers in the field to get an overview of the concepts in CFD.
<br> <br>
Course can be accessed online on <a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc26_me15/course">Swayam Portal</a></p>

<h2>About Instructor</h2>
<p>Prof. Amaresh Dalal <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/swayam-central-production.appspot.com/instructor/assets/i_323.png" style="float:left; width:30%; height:auto; margin-right:2.5em"/> is currently a Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. He received his Ph.D. degree from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2009 and he was Post-doctoral Research Associate at Purdue University from Sep 2008 - Dec 2009. He has research interests in the area of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer, Finite Volume Methods and Unstructured Grid Techniques, Multiphase Flows. Dr. Dalal is now profoundly involved in developing a general purpose, versatile and robust computational fluid dynamics solver over hybrid unstructured grid which can solve a wide range of real-life fluid flow, heat transfer, and problems involving transport phenomena over complex geometries. He received Prof KN Seetharamu Medal and Prize for the Best Young Researcher in Heat Transfer-2017 from Indian Society of Heat and Mass Transfer
