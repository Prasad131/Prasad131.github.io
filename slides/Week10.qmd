## Basics of Finite Difference Method

Consider a second order differential equations as follows

$$
A \phi_{xx}+B \phi_{xy}+C \phi_{yy} + D \phi_{x} +  E \phi_{y}+F \phi = G(x,y)
$$
$$
\begin{align}
B^{2}-4AC = 0 &  & \text{parabolic} \\
B^{2}-4AC < 0  &  & \text{elliptic} &  & \text{equilibrium problems} \\
B^{2}-4AC > 0  &  & \text{hyperbolic} &  & \text{time marching problems}
\end{align}
$$

Taylor Series expansion 

$$
f(x+\Delta x) = f(x)+\Delta x \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } +\frac{\Delta x^{2}}{2!} \frac{ \partial^{2} f }{ \partial x^{2} } + \frac{\Delta x^{3}}{3!}\frac{ \partial^{3} f }{ \partial x^{3} } +\dots
$$

First-order forward difference: 

$$
\frac{ \partial T_{i,j} }{ \partial x }=\frac{T_{i+1,j}-T_{i,j}}{\Delta x}+O(\Delta x)
$$

First-order backward difference: 
$$
\frac{ \partial T_{i,j} }{ \partial x }=\frac{T_{i,j}-T_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x}+O(\Delta x)
$$

Second-order central difference: 
$$
\frac{ \partial^{2} T_{i,j} }{ \partial x^{2} }=\frac{T_{i+1,j}-2T_{i,j}+T_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x^{2}}+O(\Delta x^{2})
$$

## Checker boarding problem 

Which of the following is the reason for checker boarding problem? 
 
- [ ] second-order central differencing of pressure term in momentum equations
- [ ] second-order central differencing of velocity term in continuity equation
- [ ] storing velocity and pressure at the same grid points

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60%}
The major reason for checker boarding problem is the decoupling due to central differencing in both continuity and momentum equations. The central differencing allows for oscillating solutions, where both continuity and momentum equations will be satisfied while it is not physically possible. 

Staggered grid allows to couple these two, so even if one of them is not physical, the solver looks for other solutions and will eventually converges to a physically consistent solution

## Discretising the advection term

Advection term $\frac{ \partial u \phi }{ \partial x }$ needs to be discretised on a 1D grid point $i$

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{ \partial (u \phi) }{ \partial x }  & = \frac{\left( u_{i+\frac{1}{2}} .\phi_{i+\frac{1}{2}}-u_{i-\frac{1}{2}}.\phi_{i-\frac{1}{2}}\right)}{\Delta x} \\
u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}.\phi_{i+\frac{1}{2}}  & =\phi_{i}. \frac{ u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}+|u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}|}{2}+\phi_{i+1}.\frac{ u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}-|u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}|}{2} &  & \text{upwind scheme} \\
 &=u_{i+\frac{1}{2}} .\frac{\phi_{i}+\phi_{i+1}}{2}+|u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}|. \frac{\phi_{i}-\phi_{i+1}}{2} \\
 & =u_{i+\frac{1}{2}} .\frac{\phi_{i}+\phi_{i+1}}{2} &  & \text{central difference} \\
 & = r (\text{upwind}) + (1-r) (\text{central}) \\
 & =u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}.\frac{\phi_{i}+\phi_{i+1}}{2}+r |u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}| .\frac{\phi_{i}-\phi_{i+1}}{2} \\
u_{i-\frac{1}{2}}.\phi_{i-\frac{1}{2}}  &= u_{i-\frac{1}{2}} .\frac{\phi_{i}+\phi_{i-1}}{2}+r |u_{i-\frac{1}{2}}|. \frac{\phi_{i-1}-\phi_{i}}{2}
\end{align}
$$

where $u_{i+\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{u_{i}+u_{i+1}}{2}$ and $u_{i-\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{u_{i}+u_{i-1}}{2}$

## Problem - Marker and cell algorithm (MAC)

Under MAC algorithm, which of the following statements are true?

- [ ] continuity equations is discretised at current time step ($n$)
- [ ] momentum equation is solved by assuming pressure from previous time step to get velocities
- [ ] pressure corrections are assumed to be zero in the neighbouring cells
- [ ] corrected velocities are obtained by solving the momentum equation with corrected pressures

. . .

MAC algorithm:

1. Discretise $\frac{Du}{Dt}=- \frac{\nabla p}{\rho}+\nu \nabla^{2}u$ 
2. Taking $p$ from previous time step solve the above equation to get $\tilde{u}$ (predicted velocity)
3. Compute actual velocity $u=\tilde{u}+k \nabla p'$, by solving $\nabla.u=\nabla.\tilde{u}+k\nabla^2 p'=0$ 
4. Update pressure values as $p^{n+1}=p^{n}+p'$ where $p^{n}=p$ . 

To accelerate convergence, the value of $k$ need to be reduced. Similarly, increasing $k$ can lead to a stable convergence

## Channel flow (parallel plates)

Consider the same problem as before except for $U=0$ and there is a constant pressure gradient of 1Pa/m, the viscosity of the fluid to be 1kg / m.s and the separation between the plates to be 1m. (The problem is meant to illustrate the application of techniques presented in the lecture videos, hence the little emphasis was given to the values of the properties. Student is advised to attempt the solution with more realistic values when needed)
