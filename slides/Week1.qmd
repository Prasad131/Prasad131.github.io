## About Course

This is introductory course on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This course will primarily cover the basics of computational fluid dynamics starting from classification of partial differential equations, linear solvers, finite difference method and finite volume method for discretizing Laplace equation, convective-diffusive equation & Navier-Stokes equations. The course will help faculty members, students and researchers in the field to get an overview of the concepts in CFD.

. . .

**INTENDED AUDIENCE** : Undergraduate and postgraduate students of Mechanical Engineering and similar branches; Faculty members associated with Mechanical Engineering; Practicing engineers associated with fluid and thermal industries.

. . .

**PREREQUISITES** :   No specific pre-requisite. Fundamental knowledge of Mathematics and Fluid Mechanics should be sufficient.
