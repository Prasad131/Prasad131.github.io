## Assumptions

-   Steady, laminar, 2D flow
-   Viscous dissipation term is neglected
-   Boundary layer approximation is valid ($\delta_T/H \ll 1$)
-   Temperature difference between plate and flud is small enough to assume constant properties of the fluid
-   Flow is incompressible - however, density will vary with location. The assumption is valid because the change in density is due to changes in temperature field

## Integral equations

**Momentum Integral Equation**

$$
\frac{d}{dy} \int_{0}^{\delta} \rho v^{2} dx = -\mu \left.\frac{ \partial v }{ \partial x } \right|_{x=0} + \int_{0}^{\delta}\rho g \beta (T-T_{\infty}) dx
$$

**Energy Integral Equation**

$$
\frac{d}{dy} \int_{0}^{\delta_{T} \approx \delta} v (T-T_{\infty})dx = -\alpha \left. \frac{ \partial T }{ \partial x }  \right|_{x=0}
$$

Approximating velocity and temperature with, $\frac{v}{v_{0}}=\frac{x}{\delta}\left( 1-\frac{x}{\delta} \right)^{2}$ and $\frac{T-T_{\infty}}{T_{w}-T_{\infty}}=\left( 1-\frac{x}{\delta} \right)^{2}$, and solving for $\delta, v$ from integral equations, we obtain,

$$
v_{0}=5.17 \frac{\nu}{y} (Pr+\frac{20}{21})^{-1/2}Gr_{y}^{1/2}
$$

and

$$
\begin{align}
h(y) & =\frac{2\kappa}{y} \frac{1}{3.93} (\frac{20}{21} \frac{1}{Pr} +1)^{-1/4}Ra_{y}^{1/4} \\
Nu_{local} & =0.508 \left( \frac{20}{21} \frac{1}{Pr} +1 \right)^{-1/4} Ra_{y}^{1/4}
\end{align}
$$

and $\overline{Nu}=\frac{4}{3} Nu_{local}$

# Problems

## Integral Solution for Uniform Heat Flux

Determine the local Nusselt number for the boundary layer natural convection along a $q''=\text{constant}$ vertical wall by performing an integral analysis using the profiles

$$
\begin{align}
T-T_{\infty}=\Delta T\left( 1-\frac{x}{\delta_{T}} \right)^{2}, &  & v=V \frac{x}{\delta}\left( 1-\frac{x}{\delta} \right)^{2}
\end{align}
$$

and taking $\delta=\delta_{T}$. Determine the expression for wall temperature profile.

## Integral Solution in Stratified Ambient {.scrollable}

Consider the integral analysis of laminar natural convection along a vertical wall bathed by a linearly stratified fluid as shown alongside. Starting with equations below, 

$$
\frac{d}{dy}\left( \int_{0}^{\delta(y)} v^{2} dx\right) = -\nu \left. \frac{ \partial v }{ \partial x }  \right|_{x=0} + g \beta \int_{0}^{\delta(y)} (T-T_{\infty}) dx
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dy} \left( \int_{0}^{\delta(y)}v (T-T_{0}) dx \right) = -\alpha \left. \frac{ \partial T }{ \partial x }  \right|_{x=0} 
$$

with  $T-T_{0}=(T_{w}-T_{0}) \left( 1-\frac{x}{\delta} \right)^{2}$ , $v=v_{0} \frac{x}{\delta} \left (1-\frac{x}{\delta}\right)^{2}$  and $T_{0}=T_{00}+\gamma y$ 

a) Derive the integral momentum and energy equations in terms of the following non-dimensional parameters

$$
\begin{align}
\delta* = \frac{\delta}{H Ra_{H}^{-1/4}} &  & y* = \frac{y}{H} \\
v* = \frac{v}{\frac{\alpha}{H}Ra_{H}^{1/2}} &  & Ra_{H}= \frac{g \beta (T_{w}-T_{00})H^{3}}{\alpha \nu} \\
b = \frac{\gamma H}{T_{w}-T_{00}}
\end{align}
$$

b) Solve these equations in the limit of $Pr\to \infty$ by setting $b\to1$

c) Compare your estimate with the literature ($\overline{Nu}=0.337 Ra_{L}^{1/4}$)

## Cooling a bottle - horizontal or vertical?

You have a bottle of water at room temperature, and you would like to drink it cold as soon as possible. The bottle has a height/diameter ratio of about 5. You place the bottle in the refrigerator; however, you have the option of positioning the bottle (1) vertically or (2) horizontally. The refrigerator cools by natural convection (it does not employ forced circulation). Which way should you position the bottle? Describe the goodness of your decision by calculating the ratio $h_{1} / h_{2}$, where $h$ refers to the heat transfer coefficient.

## Effect of orientation on heat transfer from flat plates

A long, rectangular metallic blade has width H= 4 cm and temperature Tw = 40^0^C. It is surrounded on both sides by atmospheric air at T$_{\infty}$= 20^0^C. The long side of the blade is always horizontal. Calculate the total heat transfer rate per unit of blade length when the short side of its rectangular shape (H) is (a) vertical, (b) inclined at 45^0^ relative to the vertical, and (c) horizontal. Comment on the effect that blade orientation has on the total heat transfer rate.

## Heat transfer from horizontal cylinders 

An electrical wire of diameter D= 1 mm is suspended horizontally in air of temperature 20^0^C. The Joule heating of the wire is responsible for the heat generation rate q'= 0.01 W/cm per unit length in the axial direction. The wire can be modeled as a cylinder with isothermal surface. Sufficiently far from the wire, the ambient air is motionless. Calculate the temperature difference that is established between the wire and the ambient air. (Note: This calculation requires a trial-and-error procedure; expect a relatively small Rayleigh number.)

## Effect of wall thickness on the validity of isothermal wall assumption

In many analyses of natural convection heat transfer problems, the vertical wall heating a fluid or dividing two differentially heated fluids is modeled as isothermal. This is an approximation valid in some cases and invalid in others. To be isothermal, while bathed by natural convection in boundary layer flow, a vertical solid wall must be thick enough. Comparing the thermal conductance to vertical conduction through the wall ($k_{w} W / H$) with the thermal conductance to lateral heat transfer through the same wall (and the fluid boundary layer, $kH / \delta_{T}$, determine below what range of wall widths, $W$, the ''isothermal wall'' assumption becomes inadequate ($k_{w},H,k,\delta_{T}$ are the wall thermal conductivity, wall height, fluid thermal conductivity, and thermal boundary layer thickness, respectively). For a wall of fixed geometry ($W,H$), is the isothermal wall assumption getting better or worse as $Ra_{H}$ increases?

## Heat Transfer Calculation in Mixed Convection 

Air at atmospheric pressure and 20°C is forced through a horizontal 1 in. diameter tube at an average velocity at 0.3 m/s. Tube wall is maintained at a constant temperature of 140°C. Calculate the heat-transfer coefficient for this situation if tube is 12 in. long. (For correlations refer @fig-mixedconvcorr)

## Heat Transfer in an enclosure between two parallel plates

Air at atmospheric pressure is enclosed between two vertical plates of length 1m each separated by 2 cm. The temperatures of the plates are 60°C and 100°C, respectively. Calculate the heat flux across the space. (use appropriate correlations from the slides)
