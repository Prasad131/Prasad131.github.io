## Introduction

Evaporation - surface,
Boiling - bulk

## Dimensionless Parameters

# Problems

## Bubble radius

Consider the spherical vapor bubble of radius r shown in figure below. The pressure and temperature inside the bubble $(P_{v},T_{v})$ are slightly above the pressure and temperature in the liquid $()P_{l},T_{l})$. The liquid is saturated, $T_{l}=T_{sat}$. 

(a) Invoke the mechanical equilibrium of one hemispherical control volume and derive the relation between bubble radius and pressure difference.

(b) Rely on the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron thermodynamics relation $\frac{dP}{dT}=\frac{h_{fg}}{T v_{fg}}$ and express the above equation in terms of temperature difference of vapor and saturation temperature.

(c) Calculate the radius of a steam bubble with $T_{v}-T_{sat}=2K$ in water at$T_{sat}=100^{0}C$. (Take $\sigma=0.0589 N / m$, $h_{fg}=2257 kJ / kg$, $v_{g}=1.673 m^{3} / kg$)

## Heat Transfer Rate - Steam Relief Valve in pressurised cylinder

Water boils in the pressurized cylindrical vessel shown below. The steam relief valve is set in such a way that the pressure inside the vessel is 4.76 bar. The bottom surface is made out of copper (polished), and its temperature is maintained at Tw = 160^0^C. Assume nucleate boiling, and calculate the total heat transfer rate from the bottom surface to the boiling water. Later, verify the correctness of the nucleate boiling assumption.
