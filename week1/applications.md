## Transport Phenomenon

Transport is the *movement* of a **physical quantity** driven by a force.

## Our Interests

Naturally, we would be interested in answering questions like 
- What is being transported?
- How much of it is transported?
- What is the rate of transfer?
- How can we increase/decrease the above rate?

We deal with questions like above in this course. We focus our discussion to quantities like 
momentum, energy and density/concentration.

In the above illustration, we can observe that heat energy supplied by the stove is absorbed by the dissolved gases in water resulting in the rising of bubbles as shown. These gas molecules serve as carrier and the energy is transported from the base of the stove at a higher temperature to the ambient at a lower temperature.

## Major Applications

### Understanding of natural phenomenon

- Climate Change
- Generation of dew and fog 
- Heating and cooling of earth surfaces
- Formation of rain and snow 

### Industrial Applications

- Heat exchangers
- Manufacturing technoloy
- Automobiles
- Aircrafts
- Power plants
- Electronics cooling
